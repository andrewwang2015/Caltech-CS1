<h1>CS 1: Python style guide</h1>
</div>
<p>There are a number of different ways to format Python code. Many programmers
abuse this freedom and write code that is difficult to read and thus hard to
maintain.  While there is more than one way to properly format code, here is a
set of guidelines which we have found useful in practice.  You are not required
to abide by them religiously, but we will take marks off for poor formatting.
Some of these guidelines may seem amazingly anal, but they really make a
difference when reading code.</p><p>Some of the style mistakes may not be relevant to you, because they refer to
features of Python that we haven't yet covered in the course.  You can ignore
those style mistakes for now, but check back again when we cover those
features.</p><p>Each style mistake has an associated name in bold capital letters
<b>[LIKE_THIS]</b> which we will use to identify it.</p><hr><h2>Catalog of style mistakes</h2><h3>General</h3><ul>



<li>
<b>[OPERATOR_SPACE]</b>

<p>ALWAYS surround these binary operators with a single space on either side:
assignment (<code>=</code>, <code>+=</code>, etc.), comparisons (<code>==</code>, <code>&lt;</code>, <code>&gt;</code>, <code>!=</code>, <code>&lt;=</code>,
<code>&gt;=</code>, <code>in</code>, <code>not in</code>, <code>is</code>, <code>is not</code>), booleans (<code>and</code>, <code>or</code>, <code>not</code>),
and arithmetic operators.  Example:</p>

<pre><code>  i = j + 1               # NOT i=j+1
  submitted += 1          # NOT submitted+=1
  x = x * 2 - 1           # NOT x=x*2-1
  hypot2 = x * x + y * y  # NOT hypot2=x*x+y*y
  c = (a + b) * (a - b)   # NOT c=(a+b)*(a-b)
</code></pre>

<p>Some people prefer to omit the space around <code>*</code> or <code>/</code> but leave it around
<code>+</code> and <code>-</code> as a hint about precedence, but we discourage this.  However, it's
OK to leave out spaces in array subscripts for simple increments/decrements:</p>

<pre><code>  b = a[i-1]
</code></pre>

</li>

<li>
<b>[COMMA_SPACE]</b>

<p>Always put a space after a comma.</p>

</li>

<li>
<b>[COMMENT_SPACE]</b>

<p>Always leave a space after the open-comment sign, <em>e.g.</em></p>

<pre><code>  # This comment is easy to read.
  #This comment is harder to read.
</code></pre>

</li>

<li>
<b>[LINE_LENGTH]</b>

<p>There are still many devices around (especially printers) that are limited
to 80 character lines.  The default wrapping on such devices looks
ugly. Therefore, please limit all lines to a maximum of 80 characters.</p>

<p>The preferred way of wrapping long lines is by using Python's implied line
continuation inside parentheses, brackets and braces. If necessary, you can
add an extra pair of parentheses around an expression, but sometimes using a
backslash looks better. Make sure to indent the continued line appropriately.
Some examples:</p>

<pre><code>  class Rectangle(Blob):
      def __init__(self, width, height,
                   color='black', emphasis=None, highlight=0):
          if width == 0 and height == 0 \
             and color == 'red' and emphasis == 'strong' \
             or highlight &gt; 100:
              raise ValueError, "sorry, you lose"

          if width == 0 and height == 0 and (color == 'red' \
                                             or emphasis is None):
              raise ValueError, "I don't think so"

          Blob.__init__(self, width, height,
                        color, emphasis, highlight)
</code></pre>

<p>In some cases, explicit line continuation characters are unnecessary. When in
doubt, use them anyway. Also, for long chains of booleans (<code>a and b and c...</code>)
try to put the "and" or "or" at the start of a line rather than at the end of a
line; this makes it clear that the expression is continued from the last line.</p>

</li>

<li>
<b>[BAD_NAMES]</b>

<p>Some people like to give all of their functions and variables single-letter
names.  This makes code very hard to understand for anyone reading the code
â€” including you in a few months!  Functions should have descriptive names,
without excessive abbreviation.  For instance:</p>

<pre><code>  # Bad:
  def a(r):
      '''area of circle'''
      return math.pi * r * r

  # Better:
  def area(r):
      '''Compute the area of a circle of radius r.'''
      return math.pi * r * r
</code></pre>

<p>The name of the second function suggests what it does.  However, don't go
crazy with this.  We don't want to see code like this:</p>

<pre><code>  # Too wordy:
  def AreaOfACircle(radiusOfTheCircle):
      '''Compute the area of a circle, given the radius 'radiusOfTheCircle'.
      Return the computed area.'''
      areaToReturn = math.pi * radiusOfTheCircle * radiusOfTheCircle
      return areaToReturn
</code></pre>

<p>But we also don't want unreadable abbreviations:</p>

<pre><code>  def arOfCirc(rad):
      '''Cmpt area of circ given rad'''
      return math.pi * rad * rad
</code></pre>

<p>You may know what <code>arOfCirc</code> means, but don't assume that anyone else will.</p>

<p>Names that have multiple words in them can be written in either of two styles:</p>

<pre><code>  # Multiple-word names:
  this_is_a_name = 42   # OK
  thisIsAName = 42      # Also OK
</code></pre>

<p>But these are the only two styles you should use:</p>

<pre><code>  thisisaname = 42      # Not OK -- can't see the boundaries of words

  wherearetheboundariesofthewords = 101       # See how hard this is to read?
  here_are_the_boundaries_of_the_words = 101  # See how easy this is to read?
</code></pre>

<p>Also, don't mix the two accepted styles; pick one and stick with it.</p>

<p>Variable names that are indices of a list, particularly in a loop, can be one
letter (<code>i</code> and <code>j</code> are popular choices).  However, if you're using the <code>for
&lt;item&gt; in &lt;list&gt;</code> form the <code>&lt;item&gt;</code> identifier should probably be a longer
name. For example:</p>

<pre><code>  # OK to use the name 'i' for the index of the list 'lst'.
  lst = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
  for i in range(len(lst)):
      print lst[i]

  # Use the word 'item' instead of 'i'; it's more readable.
  for item in lst:
      print item
</code></pre>

</li>

<li>
<b>[BLANK_LINES]</b>

<p>Separate top-level function and class definitions with at least two blank
lines. Also separate method definitions inside a class by one or two blank
lines. Extra blank lines may be used to separate groups of related functions
(but don't overdo it).</p>

<pre><code>  # Bad:
  def square(x):
      return x * x
  def cube(x):
      return x * x * x
  def fourthPower(x):
      return x * x * x * x

  # Better:
  def square(x):
      return x * x

  def cube(x):
      return x * x * x

  def fourthPower(x):
      return x * x * x * x
</code></pre>

<p>It's also good to put comments to separate groups of functions <em>e.g.</em></p>

<pre><code>    # These functions provide internet access for the Widget class.
</code></pre>

<p>For really significant sections, do this:</p>

<pre><code>  #
  # The class Widget implements objects that can do all kinds of neat
  # stuff.
  #
</code></pre>

<p><em>I.e.</em> have one empty comment line at the top and bottom of the
header.</p>

<p>For long functions, or long sections within a function, it is often a good
idea to have comments at the end of the function/block, <em>e.g.</em></p>

<pre><code>  def foobar(x, y, z):
      # 2000 lines of code follow...
      return 1
  # end foobar
</code></pre>

<p>Similarly, you can have <code>&nbsp;# end if</code>, <code>&nbsp;# end while</code>, etc. A
better solution is to keep functions and blocks short enough so that this isn't
needed.</p>

<p>Use blank lines in functions to indicate logical sections. We also like to
have blank lines before each <code>if</code>/<code>while</code>/<code>for</code> statement to set them off
logically from the rest of the surrounding code, which we find makes the code
more readable.</p>

<p>Do not put large numbers of empty lines (&gt; 2) between code sections unless
there is a clear need to distinguish different sections of the code.  Comments
work better than large numbers of blank lines for this purpose.</p>

</li>

<li>
<b>[INDENT_CONSISTENT]</b>

<p>Indentation levels should be consistent.  We prefer four spaces for one
indent level.  A tab should be set to be equal to four spaces if you use tabs.
(A better solution is to never use tabs.  Studies have consistently shown that
right-thinking programmers don't use tabs.)</p>

<p>Here's an example of bad indenting which is still accepted by Python (but not
by your grader!):</p>

<pre><code>  for i in range(5):
    print i

  if j &gt; 100:
        print "j is greater than 100!"

  while k &gt; 0:
      k -= 1
      print k
</code></pre>

<p>Note that the <code>for</code> loop used a two-space indent, the <code>if</code> statement used
six spaces, and the <code>while</code> loop used four spaces.  This should have looked
like this:</p>

<pre><code>  for i in range(5):
      print i

  if j &gt; 100:
      print "j is greater than 100!"

  while k &gt; 0:
      k -= 1
      print k
</code></pre>

<p>Now, the code looks neat and consistent.</p>

</li>

<li>
<b>[PRECEDENCE]</b>

<p>Use parentheses to show operator precedence in all cases except that of
multiplication/division over addition/subtraction and assignment
statements.</p>

</li>

<li>
<b>[MAGIC_NUMBER]</b>

<p>Avoid putting a number into a file which has no obvious relevance to
the surrounding code.  This is known as a "magic number".  Instead, define it
as a variable at the top of the file.</p>

</li>

<li>
<b>[USELESS_CODE]</b>

<p>Don't put in code that has no function or no effect.  If it's code that's
was only used for debugging purposes, it should be removed before you submit
your assignment.</p>

</li>

<li>
<b>[STMTS_ON_LINE]</b>

<p>Do not put multiple statements in one line, not even very simple ones. It's
just confusing and hard to read. Similarly, we dislike this:</p>

<pre><code>  if not line: break
</code></pre>

<p>and prefer:</p>

<pre><code>  if not line:
      break
</code></pre>

<p>Remember: there is no tax on newlines. Do not try to cram as much as you can
in one line.</p>

</li>

<li>
<b>[BAD WHITESPACE]</b>

<p>Don't use whitespace in the following places:</p>

<ul>

<li>
<p>Immediately inside parentheses or square brackets, as in:</p>

<pre><code>  spam( ham[ 1 ] )
</code></pre>

<p>Always write this as:</p>

<pre><code>  spam(ham[1])
</code></pre>

</li>

<li>
<p>Immediately before a comma, semicolon, or colon, as in:</p>

<pre><code>  if x == 4 :
      print x , y
      x , y = y , x
</code></pre>

<p>Always write this as:</p>

<pre><code>  if x == 4:
      print x, y
      x, y = y, x
</code></pre>

</li>

<li>
 
<p>Immediately before the open parenthesis that starts the argument list of a
function call, as in:</p>

<pre><code>  spam (1)
</code></pre>

<p>Always write this as:</p>

<pre><code>  spam(1)
</code></pre>

</li>

<li>
 
<p>Immediately before the open square bracket that starts an indexing or slicing
operation, as in:</p>

<pre><code>  dict ['key'] = list [index]
</code></pre>

<p>Always write this as:</p>

<pre><code>  dict['key'] = list[index]
</code></pre>

</li>

<li>
 
<p>Excessive amounts of space around an assignment (or other) operator to align
it with another, <em>e.g.</em>:</p>

<pre><code>  x             = 1
  y             = 2
  long_variable = 3
</code></pre>

<p>A good rule of thumb is: if you have to move the operator eight or more
spaces, don't waste your time. Otherwise, do the alignment.  <em>E.g.</em>, change:</p>

<pre><code>  x = 1
  foo = 2
  fudge = 5
</code></pre>

<p>to:</p>

<pre><code>  x     = 1
  foo   = 2
  fudge = 5
</code></pre>

<p>but leave</p>

<pre><code>  x = 1
  y = 2
  this_variable_name_is_really_long = 3
</code></pre>

<p>alone. This is a bit of a judgment call.</p>

</li>

</ul>

</li>

<li>
 
<b>[KEYWORD_SPACES]</b>

<p>Don't use spaces around the '=' sign when used to indicate a keyword argument
or a default parameter value. For instance, instead of:</p>

<pre><code>  def complex(real, imag = 0.0):
      return magic(r = real, i = imag)
</code></pre>

<p>write:</p>

<pre><code>  def complex(real, imag=0.0):
      return magic(r=real, i=imag)
</code></pre>

</li>

<li>
 
<b>[IMPORT]</b>

<p>In general, avoid using <code>from X import *</code>; either do this:</p>

<pre><code>  from X import Y  # For a single function that's used a lot.
</code></pre>

<p>or do this:</p>

<pre><code>  import X   # For a module where we need a lot of functions.
</code></pre>

<p>Also, <strong>do not use</strong> <code>import X</code> <strong>or</strong> <code>from X import Y</code> <strong>inside a class
or function.</strong> We've never seen a case where it's necessary, and it just makes
things confusing. Put all <code>import</code> statements at the toplevel and at the
beginning of the file. That way, we know where to look for them. It's up to you
whether to format them as</p>

<pre><code>  import X, Y, Z
</code></pre>

<p>or</p>

<pre><code>  import X
  import Y
  import Z
</code></pre>

<p>We tend to use the former for quick throwaway scripts and the latter for
larger projects.</p>

</li>

</ul><h3>Comments</h3><ul>

<li>
 
<b>[COMMENTS_FULL_SENTENCES]</b>

<p>If a comment is a phrase or sentence, its first word should be capitalized,
unless it is an identifier that begins with a lower case letter (never alter the
case of identifiers!).  We prefer comments that are complete sentences.  You
should use two spaces after a sentence-ending period.  Ideally, refer to
identifiers with surrounding quotes, <em>e.g.</em></p>

<pre><code>  # The variable 'nitems' represents the number of items in the stack.
</code></pre>

<p>If a comment is very short, it doesn't have to be a full sentence or end in a
period <em>e.g.</em></p>

<pre><code>  i = 1  # loop index
</code></pre>

<p>This is called an "inline comment".  Use these only when describing something
<em>i.e.</em> in the above code snippet you're saying "The variable 'i' represents a
loop index."</p>

</li>

<li>
<b>[COMMENT_GRAMMATICAL]</b>

<p>Comments should be correctly spelled (no typos) and be grammatically correct.
We don't want to sound like your high school English teacher, but it's rilly
unplesant to read coments that hav speling or grmatacial or tpyogarphic rrors.</p>

</li>

<li>
<b>[COMMENT_NON_OBVIOUS]</b>

<p>Write comments for anything that isn't completely obvious from the context.
In particular, write comments for any tricky algorithm or code you are using.
Also put a comment at the beginning of each function describing what it does.
When in doubt, comment more rather than less.</p>

</li>

<li>
<b>[COMMENT_REDUNDANT]</b>

<p>Comments should not restate the obvious.  This is especially common with
inline comments.  Example:</p>

<pre><code>  x = x + 1   # increment x
</code></pre>

</li>

<li>
<b>[COMMENT_MEANINGLESS]</b>

<p>Don't make meaningless comments <em>e.g.</em></p>

<pre><code>  i = 1   # i
</code></pre>

<p>Don't laugh; we've actually seen this sort of thing.</p>

</li>

<li>
<b>[COMMENTS_CONSISTENT_WITH_CODE]</b>

<p>Comments that contradict the code are worse than no comments. ALWAYS MAKE A
PRIORITY OF KEEPING THE COMMENTS UP-TO-DATE WHEN THE CODE CHANGES!</p>

</li>

<li>
<b>[COMMENT_INDENT]</b>

<p>Always indent your comments to the same degree as the surrounding code.</p>

</li>

<li>
<b>[COMMENT_INLINE]</b>

<p>Try to line up inline comments where convenient. In other words, don't do
this:</p>

<pre><code>  x = x + 1       # some cool comment about x
  y = y + 1   # some even cooler comment about y
</code></pre>

<p>Instead, do this:</p>

<pre><code>  x = x + 1       # some cool comment about x
  y = y + 1       # some even cooler comment about y
</code></pre>

</li>

<li>
<b>[COMMENT_PRECEDING]</b>

<p>Do not write comments that apply to the preceding code if you can possibly
avoid it.  Try to write comments that refer to the current line of code or to
the lines of code which immediately follow.</p>

</li>

<li>
<b>[COMMENT_BLOCK]</b>

<p>Block comments generally apply to some (or all) code that follows them, and
are indented to the same level as that code. Each line of a block comment starts
with a <code>#</code> and a single space (unless it is indented text inside the comment).
Paragraphs inside a block comment are separated by a line containing a single
<code>#</code>. Block comments are best surrounded by a blank line above and below them
(or two lines above and a single line below for a block comment at the start of
a a new section of function definitions).  We always like to start and end a
block comment with a line containing a single <code>#</code>; this is a matter of personal
preference. In other words, a block comment looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>  #
  # The first line comes after an empty line.
  #
  # Separate paragraphs are also separated by an empty line,
  # and there's an empty line at the end.
  #
</code></pre>

<p>Block comments at the top of a file or at the beginning of a class or
function should be turned into docstrings (see below).</p>

</li>

</ul><h3>Documentation Strings</h3><ul>

<li>
<b>[DOCSTRINGS]</b>

<p>All modules should normally have docstrings, and all functions and classes
exported by a module should also have docstrings. Public methods (including the
<code>__init__</code> constructor) should also have docstrings. When in doubt, add a
docstring to all functions. Otherwise, you'd have to add a comment indicating
the purpose of the function anyway, so why not have docstrings?</p>

<p>For consistency, always use triple quotes around docstrings.  This allows the
docstring to span multiple lines.  You can use either triple-single-quotes
(<code>'''</code>) or triple-double-quotes (<code>"""</code>), but please use the same style for the
entire file.</p>

</li>

</ul><h3>Functions</h3><ul>

<li>
<b>[FUNCTION_DECOMPOSITION]</b>

<p>Don't hesitate to decompose your functions into lots of smaller functions
where appropriate.  Don't write functions that are pages and pages of text in
length.</p>

</li>

</ul><h3>Exception handling</h3><ul>

<li>
<b>[EXCEPTIONS_CATCH_ALL]</b>

<p>Don't catch all exceptions and then ignore them, like this:</p>

<pre><code>  try:
      # code goes here
  except: # catch all exceptions
      pass
</code></pre>

<p>If you don't want to deal with errors at all, don't put a <code>try: ... except:
...</code> condition in at all, but add a comment for later if you intend to
eventually catch certain exceptions:</p>

<pre><code>  # FIXME: catch FooError that could be raised by function bar().
</code></pre>

</li>

<li>
<b>[USAGE_STMT]</b>

<p>If a program is called with incorrect arguments or the wrong number of
arguments, it should detect that, print a usage statement to the terminal, and
exit.  The usage statement should start with the word "usage" (in lower case)
and should include the program name.  The easiest way to get the program name is
to use <code>sys.argv[0]</code> <em>i.e.</em></p>

<pre><code>  import sys, os.path

  # Get the program name without the full pathname.
  prog_name = os.path.basename(sys.argv[0])

  usage = "usage: %s input_filename output_filename" % prog_name

  if len(sys.argv) != 2:
     print &gt;&gt; sys.stderr, usage
     sys.exit(1)
</code></pre>

<p>Note that we are using the <code>&nbsp;print &gt;&gt;&nbsp;</code> syntax to print to
<code>sys.stderr</code>.</p>

<p>Also note that the <code>sys.exit()</code> function has an argument of 1.  If you just
call it with no arguments (<em>i.e.</em> <code>sys.exit()</code> instead of <code>sys.exit(1)</code>) it
isn't right.  On Unix systems (like Linux), the <code>exit</code> function returns an
integer value to the operating system (OS) which tells the OS if the program
exited successfully or not.  If this integer is 0, that means a successful exit;
anything else (like 1) means that an error occurred.  By default, <code>sys.exit()</code>
will return a 0, so we have to specifically tell it to return 1 (because here an
error has occurred) by giving it the argument 1.</p>

<p>Note that the program arguments in the usage message have mnemonic names.  Of
course, your argument names will probably be different from "<code>input_filename</code>"
and "<code>output_filename</code>" and there may be more or fewer arguments.  If some of
the arguments are optional, they should be put into square brackets.  Typically,
optional arguments have a leading "<code>-</code>" (dash) to indicate that they're
optional, and if they are followed by extra arguments, those come after the
argument with the dash.  Here's an example:</p>

<pre><code>  usage: myprogram [-f filename] n1 n2 n3
</code></pre>

<p>This says that the program name is "<code>myprogram</code>"; it takes three required
arguments "<code>n1</code>", "<code>n2</code>", and "<code>n3</code>" (these probably represent integers), and
there is an optional argument called "<code>filename</code>" which has a preceding "<code>-f</code>"
argument. Note how the usage message has the optional arguments in square
brackets.  Of course, when you invoke the program you don't use the square
brackets.  You'd invoke it like this:</p>

<pre><code>  % myprogram 10 20 30
</code></pre>

<p>without the optional argument, or:</p>

<pre><code>  % myprogram -f foobar 10 20 30
</code></pre>

<p>with the optional argument (the filename here is "<code>foobar</code>").
The % character is the unix prompt.</p>

<p>Also, a lot of people learning Python seem to like to write the arguments of
usage messages in angle brackets like this:</p>

<pre><code>  usage: myprog &lt;input_filename&gt; &lt;output_filename&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>This is a bad idea, because on Unix systems (like the CS cluster computers)
the &lt; and &gt; characters are operators that mean specific things when typed in at
the prompt (they redirect input and output).  Instead, this should be written as
just:</p>

<pre><code>  usage: myprog input_filename output_filename
</code></pre>
