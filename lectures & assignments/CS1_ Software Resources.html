<p>For this class, we will be using the Python programming language. The Python
home page is at <a href="http://www.python.org/">http://www.python.org</a>. We will be using Python version
2.7.10; that version is available <a href="http://python.org/downloads">here</a>.
Python documentation for this version can be found
<a href="http://docs.python.org/release/2.7.10/">here</a>. In particular, we
recommend you look at the library (module) documentation, which is located
<a href="http://docs.python.org/release/2.7.10/library/index.html">here</a>.</p><p>Python is installed on the CMS cluster; but if you want to install your own
version, assignment 1 will walk you through the process.  (You should definitely
install Python on your computer; for one thing, Wing IDE may not be installed on
the CMS cluster, so you would have to use a different setup.)  If you have a
computer running Linux or Mac OS X, chances are Python is already installed,
though perhaps not the version we will be using.  Having the correct version is
important, because some of the Python libraries we'll be using may not work
properly with other versions. In particular, using a later version of Python is
not recommended.</p><p>The development environment we will be using to write our Python programs is
called "Wing 101". It is available for free
<a href="http://wingware.com/downloads/wingide-101">here</a>. If you decide at some
point that you really love this IDE and want the best version available, you can
get a commercial version which has many additional features at the main WingWare
site: <a href="http://www.wingware.com/">http://www.wingware.com/</a>.  The free version will be adequate for
our needs in this course.</p>
